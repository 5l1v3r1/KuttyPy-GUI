# Enclosure Designs

To create an enclosure, one can export the svg outline from KiCAD, and use a suitable tool
such as inkscape to create drawings for laser cutting and engraving.

A sample drawing has been made and laser cut from 3mm thick acrylic 

## Example

This is an svg file, and is made to dimensions. Right click, and 'save as'
